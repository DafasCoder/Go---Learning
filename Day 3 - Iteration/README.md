# Day 3 - Iteration

What we learn today!!!

1. Iterator functions only used for in go(NOOO WHILE,DO or UNTIL)
2. When the benchmark code is executed, it runs b.N times and measures how long it takes.
   - To use benchmark make sure to "Benchmark" in front of the test function
   - default benchmarks are run sequentially
   - go test -bench=. is how you run it
