# Day 5 - Structs, Method and Interfaces

What did we learn today!!!!!

1. Structs area similar to object allows to declare the varible we want use for that specific object

2. Method allows us to overide a certain function that serves the same purpose but has different calulation

3. Interface are so you define functions for different types(structs). It only check if those method for each struct matches.

4. Table driven tests to make your assertions clearer and your test suites easier to extend & maintain
